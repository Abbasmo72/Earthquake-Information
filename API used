 The API used is from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which provides real-time earthquake data. USGS is a well-known and trusted source for geological information, including global earthquake data. The API allows users to retrieve earthquake information in various formats, including GeoJSON.
Web Site : https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards
API URL: urlData = "http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_day.geojson"
This URL points to a GeoJSON file that provides information about earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.5 or greater from the past day.

Data Structure:
The USGS earthquake API returns data in the GeoJSON format, which is a widely used standard for geographic data. The returned data includes the following key components:

metadata: Contains metadata about the request, including the title, count of recorded events, and more.
features: A list of earthquake events, each with attributes such as the location of the earthquake, magnitude (mag), number of felt reports, and other related information.
API Workflow:
The code uses urllib.request to send an HTTP request to the API. After receiving the response (which is indicated by a status code of 200, meaning the request was successful), the data is read and parsed into JSON format.

This API is publicly available and provided for free by USGS, allowing access to up-to-date earthquake data across the globe. It enables users to retrieve and display earthquake details such as magnitude, location, and reports of whether people felt the earthquake.
