Overview
The script fetches earthquake data from the US Geological Survey (USGS) API and processes the data to display information about recent earthquakes. It specifically focuses on earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or higher, lists their locations, and indicates how many felt reports have been submitted for each earthquake.

Code Breakdown
Importing Libraries:

json: This library is used to parse JSON data, which is the format in which the USGS API returns earthquake data.
urllib.request: This library is used to make HTTP requests to retrieve the data from the USGS API.
Function printResults(data):

Input: Takes a single parameter, data, which is expected to be a JSON-formatted string containing earthquake information.
JSON Parsing: The json.loads(data) function converts the JSON string into a Python dictionary (theJSON).
Metadata:
The code checks if the metadata contains a title and prints it.
It retrieves the count of recorded events from the metadata and prints it.
List Earthquake Locations:
It iterates over each earthquake event in theJSON['features'], extracting and printing the location (place) of each earthquake.
Separation of Events:
A line of dashes is printed for clarity.
Magnitude Filtering:
The code checks the magnitude of each earthquake (i['properties']['mag']) and prints the location of those with a magnitude of 4.0 or higher.
Felt Reports:
It prints a header for felt reports and checks each earthquake for felt reports (feltReports). If reports are available and greater than zero, it prints the location along with the number of times it was felt.
Function main():

API Endpoint: The URL for fetching earthquake data is defined.
HTTP Request: urllib.request.urlopen(urlData) sends a request to the API and stores the response in webUrl.
Response Check:
The response code is printed. If the code is 200 (indicating success), it reads the data and calls the printResults(data) function to process it.
If the response code is not 200, an error message is printed.
Execution Entry Point:

The code checks if the script is being run directly (if __name__ == "__main__":). If true, it calls the main() function to start the process.
Summary
This script effectively retrieves and displays data about recent earthquakes, focusing on magnitude and felt reports. It is a practical example of how to interact with an external API, process JSON data, and present it in a user-friendly format.
