### 1. Tremor Tracker:
This Python code is designed to retrieve and display recent earthquake information from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) API. It uses the urllib.request library to fetch earthquake data in JSON format from a specified URL. The printResults function processes this data, first printing the title and the number of recorded earthquake events. Then, it lists the locations of all earthquakes and separately displays those with a magnitude of 4.0 or greater. Finally, it checks and prints the number of times the earthquakes were felt in each location. In the main function, after establishing a connection to the URL, the code sends the retrieved data to the printResults function for processing if the request is successful. If there is an error in retrieving the data, an error message is displayed to the user.

### 2. Quake Monitor:
This program retrieves earthquake data above a magnitude of 4.0 from the past 24 hours worldwide using the USGS Earthquake API. The fetch_earthquake_data() function constructs a URL to request data in JSON format, filtering by time range and earthquake magnitude. The format_time() function converts the earthquake time from UTC to a readable date and time. Each earthquake entry is processed to extract details such as location, city, country, coordinates, magnitude, and exact time. The data is stored in a dictionary, grouping earthquakes by country and then by city. The display_earthquake_data() function sorts countries alphabetically and prints each countryâ€™s information in a readable format. For each country, affected cities, geographic coordinates, magnitude, and time of each earthquake are displayed. This allows users to view recent seismic activity worldwide, organized by country and city.
